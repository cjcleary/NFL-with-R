# **Thank you for visiting this git repo!**

The purpose of this repo is for me to learn github and to play around with NFL-based R data. Primarily, I plan to extend the use of the [{nflfastR}](https://www.nflfastr.com/) and [{nflreadr}](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/) packages.

For example, the first commit I had with this repo was the addition of the [nfl-rushing-statistics dataset](https://github.com/cjcleary/NFL-with-R/tree/main/Data%20Files/nfl-rushing-statistics).
