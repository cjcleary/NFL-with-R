# **Thank you for visiting this git repo!**

The purpose of this repo is for me to learn github and to play around with NFL-based R data. Primarily, I plan to extend the use of the [{nflfastR}](https://www.nflfastr.com/) and [{nflreadr}](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/) packages.

For example, the first commit I had with this repo was the addition of the [nfl-rushing-statistics dataset](https://github.com/cjcleary/NFL-with-R/tree/main/Data%20Files/nfl-rushing-statistics). All data sets provided in the Data Files folder are from the NFL merger to present (1970-now). The scripts used to scrape these data from profootballrefernce are provided in the code folder.
